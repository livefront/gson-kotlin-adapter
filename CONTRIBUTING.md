# Contributing to Kraft

Contributions to the project are welcome! All external contributors should fork the repository and submit pull requests against the `master` branch. These must pass the checks run by CI and be reviewed and approved by a primary contributor before they can be merged. Prior to merging, the branch should be rebased with the latest changes from master and commits should be squashed where appropriate in order to cleanly encapsulate the final set of changes (i.e. no "Addressed review comment" commits should be present).
